# k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman for Group Isomorphism

An implementation of the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman method to test Group Isomorphism between 2 groups given by a list of generators. Starts up with by only implementing the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman method and then generalizes for any k.
